If you don't find any info.txt files inside the folder of the customization
you want to install, then you will only need to move the files into the skin's folder.
Don't move the folder, only the contents inside of it.

Sometimes there will be info folders that contain PSDs, preview PNGs or/and info.txt.

It's not necessary to move the info.txt file or the info folder.

I recommend you to create a copy of the skin folder for your customization, so you can
switch between the customized and the default one easily. An example where this might be
useful is a customization such as playfield border, that works as well in standard but
appears weird in mania. This is how my skins folder is right now, to give you an idea:
